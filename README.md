1. **collector.py:** a python file that contains the line of code needed to collect your data from the html page (from which you get the urls) and Wikipedia

2. **collector_utils.py:** a python file that stores the function you used in *collector.py*.

3. **parser.py:** a python file that contains the line of code needed to parse the entire collection of html pages and save those in *tsv* files.

4. **parser_utils.py**: a python file that gathers the function you used in *parser.py*.

5. **index.py:** a python file that once executed generate the indexes of the *Search engines*.

6. **index_utils.py:** a python file that contains the functions you used for creating *indexes*.

7. **utils.py:** a python file that gather functions you need in more than one of the previous files like (*collector, parser, etc.*)

**search_engine:** a parameter that the user set to choose the search engine to run. According to the request of the homework, you can   get 1,2 or 3.

9. **exercise_4.py:** python file that contains the implementation of the algorithm that solves problem 4.

10. **main.ipynb:** a Jupyter notebook explaines the strategies you adopted solving the homework and the Bonus point (visualization task). The notebook must be clear, complete and tidy. Here an example of a nice notebook from last year. Avoid pushing on GitHub notebook that contain entire long printed list, otherwise we will not be able to open it.
